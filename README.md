# Let-s-wget-This-Bread

### Objective:
We will be using the Linux Audit daemon set up in this lab to perform the following:
- Watch a protected directory of our filesystem through writing custom audit.rules
- Run provided attack scripts that will alter some files in that directory
- Identify which files in our filesystem were modified by reviewing the audit ouput and filtering on a filter key via ausearch

In this lab...
- I learned how to set rules using the IDS: AuditD on specific files.
